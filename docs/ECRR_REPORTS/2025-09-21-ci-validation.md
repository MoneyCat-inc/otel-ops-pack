# ECRR Report — CI Validation Status (2025-09-21)

## Examine
- gh run list --workflow ".github/workflows/ci.yml" --limit 1 → latest run **17889733811** shows conclusion: failure; GitHub returned an empty jobs array (workflow did not execute steps).
- Previous run **17889545563** artifact (otel_art/collector.log) still reports logging exporter has been deprecated and contained no service.name = ci-cat span.
- No new GitHub workflow execution has completed since the inline config indentation fix; background monitor remains waiting for a successful run.

## Clean
- Ensured config.yaml and .github/workflows/ci.yml rely on the debug exporter (no residual logging entries).
- Normalized the heredoc block in .github/workflows/ci.yml (leading spaces removed) to unblock config parsing.
- Spun up background monitor (monitor-ci-background.ps1) plus lightweight status checks; no additional remediation applied pending fresh CI signal.

## Report
- Evidence commands: gh run list, gh run download, Select-String against otel_art/collector.log.
- Outstanding work: trigger/confirm a fresh CI - quality gates run, capture otel-collector-logs, validate absence of deprecated exporter warnings, confirm ci-cat span.
- Supporting scripts staged: collect-validation-evidence.ps1, check-validation-status.ps1, cleanup-test-artifacts.ps1.
